PTT Goal:
+ custom config with a mixture of travel need but also good reachable main hideout
+ Dynamic Maps labes
+ Trader locations for Custom Traders
+ Transfer / Send items to main stash mechanic? (Maybe like Raidoverhaul with a pickup)

Dynamic Maps Goal:
+ Integration of paper map requirement to use ingame map, but without any markers
+ Phone unlocks GPS so you unlock your own location as marker
+ With BDB no Door markers needed
+ Other markers are only available wit the consumption of decrypted intel --> rng unlock map markers
+ Other player markers are allways off
+ maybe Satelite/ UAV item in lategame to unlock hotzones

  Implementation:
  + Hotzones are coded and wait for CJs rework of minimap for Push Request
  + Requirements to show Map is missing: should be easy with item id in public var (maybe changeable via f12 advanced) and different mod should be able to override / set that ID to allow limmiting like mentioned above

Crafter Goal:
+ rework of reciepts to be locked behind quests like the vanilla craft equivalents --> maybe dont use crafter but use MoreHideoutCrafts with multiple configs

Crafting:
+ New Crafts for Armor and armor plates
  + Refurbishing of Armor plates to a lower protection
  + allow exchange of shape to fit different armor carriers
+ lock all crafts behind knwoledge
  + Books like SkillsExtendet --> Quests to consume / read those books and gain access to crafting reciepes
    + Split armor plates into material, refurbishing, reshaping
    + maybe create mechanic to destroy plate carries to learn how to craft them
+ only civil version of weapons availabe at the start
  + learning some crafts to convert weapons to militäry version
  + learn some weapon crafts

  Implementation:
    + should be easy with MoreHideoutCrafts and crafting editor
    + new quests needed for learning mechanic to lock crafts behind it

Bronzeman / Loot overhaul :
+ only allow buy/ of civil weapon versions at the beginning until higher tier or find them in militäry areas
